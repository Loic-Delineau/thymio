## Gantry
You will find all information regarding the gantry in the 
![gantry/](./gantry) directory.

The gantry is the large jig designed to slide right over a workbench 
tabletop like the ones you find in the DLLELL Atrium Room (The SPOT). 

The stock needed to build a gantry is:

- 3x 800x930mm 3mm MDF

This stock will cost you a total of:

- 12CHF

You can find this exact stock already cut to those exact dimensions 
inside the mechanical lab of DLL, say hi to Ivan for me ;)

The MDF is designed to be laser cut such that it perfecty assembles and 
disassembles for storage in a very tight 9mm large slot as to save space.

The gantry also includes holes for routing the Aukey 1080P Webcam 
USB cable and its ferrite choke as provided by the professor 
for the MICRO-452 EPFL class. 

Finally a 3D printed part that holds the camera and slots inside of the
crossbeam is also provided.

It is recommended to use the:

- lightburn file (.lbrn)
- binary gcode file (.bgcode)

To get the same results as all tolerances will already be accounted for.
