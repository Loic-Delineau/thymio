## Gantry
You will find all information regarding the gantry in the 
![gantry/](./gantry) directory.

The gantry is the large jig designed to slide right over a workbench 
tabletop like the ones you find in the DLLELL Atrium Room (The SPOT). 

The stock needed to build a gantry is:

- 3x 800x930mm 3mm MDF

This stock will cost you a total of:

- 16.38CHF (7.34CHF/m2)

You can find this exact stock already cut to those exact dimensions 
inside the mechanical lab of DLL, say hi to Ivan for me ;)

The MDF is designed to be laser cut such that it perfecty assembles and 
disassembles for storage in a very tight 9mm large slot as to save space.

On the DLL Laser cutter with a 150W CO2 Tube:
- 350mm/s @ 35% power for the engraving
- 25mm/s @ 80% power for the cutting

The gantry also includes holes for routing the Aukey 1080P Webcam 
USB cable and its ferrite choke as provided 
for the MICRO-452 EPFL class. 

Finally a 3D printed part holds the camera and slots inside of the
crossbeam, it is also provided in the ![gantry/](./gantry) directory. 

To get the same results after all the machine tolerances,
it is recommended to use the:

- lightburn file (.lbrn2)        --> 150W CO2 Laser from DLLEL
- binary gcode file (.bgcode)	 --> Prusa MK4 from DLL
